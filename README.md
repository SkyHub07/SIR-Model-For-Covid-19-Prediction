# SIR-Model-For-Covid-19-Prediction
I have used MATLAB to build this SIR Model to predict the COVID-19 cases in INDIA.
-An SIR model is an epidemiological model that computes the theoretical number of people infected with a contagious illness in a closed population over time. The name of this class of models derives from the fact that they involve coupled equations relating the number of susceptible people S(t), number of people infected I(t), and number of people who have recovered R(t). One of the simplest SIR models is the Kermack-McKendrick model.

-Install MATLAB to your system to run this model.
